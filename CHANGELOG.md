# CHANGELOG for 'nas' script

## 1.1.0 Config file location

* Moving config file location to /etc/nas.conf for system wide use. This lets root use it as well as users calling it via sudo.

## 1.0.0 Adding versioning to 'nas' script

* Semantic versioning at v1.0.0 for use with releases and Chef automation

* Adding install script so release can be downloaded as .tgz file and installed via automation

* MIT license instead of Apache. Just moving all my misc scripts to MIT license
